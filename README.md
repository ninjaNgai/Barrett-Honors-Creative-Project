# Barrett-Honors-Creative-Project

The topic of my Creative Project centers on the question of “How can the audience's choices influence dancers' improvisation?” This dance work seeks to redefine the relationship between audience and performers through integration of audience, technology, and movement in real-time. The two web applications "Master Poll" and "Client Poll" were coded in Python.
